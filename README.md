#Run
GUI made with PySimpleGUI, which is easier GUI solution for new programmers.
Make sure you have PySimpleGUI installed first:
    
    pip install pysimplegui
or

    pip3 install pysimplegui
    
Note: I am a colorist, not a programmer. Though the tool is non-destructive, please test in your non-production environment.
